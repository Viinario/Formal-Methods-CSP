# FDR4m with CSP - Repository

## üìö What is FDR?

FDR4 is an advanced tool designed for analyzing and verifying systems with formal methods. It leverages **CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes)**, a formal language for describing patterns of interaction in concurrent systems. FDR4 allows users to:

- **Model** system behaviors formally.
- **Verify** properties like safety, liveness, and deadlock freedom.
- **Test** equivalence between processes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Objectives

- To provide examples and templates for modeling systems using CSP.
- To demonstrate the verification and validation capabilities of FDR4m.
- To share practical applications of formal methods in real-world scenarios.
